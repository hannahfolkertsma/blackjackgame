*about*

- This is a game of blackjack on an ASP.NET Web App. This app uses ASP.NET MVC alongside JQuery alongside custom designed pixel art assets.
- The font is "Pixelify Sans" from Google Fonts.
   \n *features*
- Play a game of blackjack against an automatic dealer.
 
*TODO - further enhancements*
