*about:*

- This is a game of blackjack on an ASP.NET Web App. This app uses ASP.NET MVC alongside JQuery alongside custom designed pixel art assets.
- This game follows the standard Blackjack rules from Bicycle cards.
- The font is "Pixelify Sans" from Google Fonts.
- 
*TODO - further enhancements*

 - implement betting, splitting and doubling down as game mechanics
 - add a delay between cards being drawn so that it looks more like cards are being dealt - this proved difficult and wasn't feasible under this timeline
